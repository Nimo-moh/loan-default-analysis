Data cleaning and normalization of loan default data using python and z-core scalling
# Loan Default Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean and normalize a loan default dataset using Python. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning by handling missing values and normalizing numeric features.

## Objective
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Normalize numeric columns using z-score.

## Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, SciPy)
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Scaling (Z-Score Normalization)

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- SciPy

## Steps Performed
1. Imported the dataset and explored its structure.
2. Identified and handled missing values.
3. Normalized numeric columns using z-score for consistency.

## Results
- Successfully prepared a cleaned and normalized dataset.
- Enhanced data readiness for analysis and modeling.
